- Download and install Launch4j
- Make a jar of app in Intellij -> project settings -> artifacts -> new -> jar from module main
	(The result will be in the Intellij output folder: out/artifacts/app/...)
- Unneeded files in the jar such as javafxweb.dll can be deleted to reduce its size significantly
- In launch4j specify at least the following in each tab:
	- Basic tab: Outputfile, Jar, Icon
	- Classpath tab: Main class (com.pleon.donim.MainKt), Classpath (.)
	- JRE tab: Min JRE version (10)
- Click Save configuration [disk icon] then Build wrapper [gear icon] to make the app .exe file
- Place everything in app resources folder in the same folder as the .exe file
    Another option is to copy everything in resources folder to the jar file and then read the files
    with getResourceAsStream instead of getResource in the code
- Click Test wrapper [play icon] (or double click .exe)
