# ![logo](logo-animated.svg) Donim

![Main screen](screenshot/main-screen.png)

### The name
Donim is composed of two Persian words: "do" meaning *two* and "nim" meaning *half*.
So it basically means something that consists of two parts (or two halves).

### The logo
The logo is inspired from the well-known [yin and yang][1] symbol.
I found a striking similarity between Donim logo and [this][2] (notice the colors!).

For creating an installer for app with new jpackage tool in Java 14:
jpackage -i ./ --main-class com.pleon.donim.MainKt --main-jar Donim.main.jar --win-dir-chooser --name Donim

A striking similarity between my logo and this (Notice the colors!):
