### The name
"Donim" is composed of two Persian words: "do" meaning *two* and "nim" meaning *half*.  
So it basically means something that consists of two parts (or two halves).

### The logo
It is inspired from the well-known [yin and yang][3] symbol.  
I found a striking similarity between Donim logo and [this][4] (notice the colors!).
