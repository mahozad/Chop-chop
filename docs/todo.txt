- when the timer goes into pending (on hold) state, show a glowing animation
(from inside of the ring to outside of the ring). We can use clips and masks to 
restrict the animation to the ring.

- check for OS theme every n seconds (for exmaple, every 5 seconds) to update
the application theme. This is for when the computer goes to sleep in one theme
and awakes a few hours later with another theme which seems not to be reflected in 
the application theme

- add a cancel button in settings screen that reverts the current changes to their previous
values and closes the settings window
